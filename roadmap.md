ToDo:
- A 3rd button during the confirm/deny prompt 'edit' could be use to solicit user input on the name, in the case that there is an extra character, or misspelling
- A delete function that can remove files from the library (maybe not though, manual deletion will be safe and more deliberate)
- a funtion to return a list of 'options'. Currently if there is more than 1, it's a guess which one is chosen?
