### Issue Context

There is something that causes a "slowdown". When I use the same test case the timing of the scrape operations are not consistent. Analyze of the logs (one 'fast' and one 'slow') shows a key difference:

- fast.log: The scrape operation runs once, processes 5 items, and completes in approximately 1.4 seconds.

- slow.log: The scrape operation runs, processes 5 items, and then instead of completing, it triggers a retry. This happens twice, meaning the entire process runs a total of three times before finally completing, taking approximately 4.2 seconds (roughly 3 x 1.4s).

The crucial observation is that the retry is triggered after the log indicates all 5 items have been processed. This suggests there is a validation step at the end of the operation that is failing silently, causing the system to attempt the scrape again.

### Proposed Plan

Here is a two-step plan, standard procedure for debugging this kind of issue. It is methodical and guaranteed to find the root cause.

#### **Step 1: Improve Logging at the Decision Point (Highest Priority)**

This is non-negotiable and the most important thing to do next. You cannot fix a bug you cannot see. The application is hiding the reason for the failure.

*   **What to Log:** Your suggestion to log the condition that failed is perfect. The log should be as verbose as possible. For example:
    *   `"Retrying scrape. Reason: Validation failed. Function 'validate_results_integrity()' returned False."`
    *   `"Retrying scrape. Reason: Mismatch in expected item count. Expected >= 1, Found: 5. Validation logic might be flawed."`
    *   `"Retrying scrape. Reason: Required success element '.results-header' not found on page after processing."`

#### **Step 2: Review the Post-Processing Validation Logic**

Your guiding questions for this review are excellent. Based on the context of a torrent scraper, here are the most likely culprits, in order of probability:

1.  **A "Success Element" Check is Failing:** This is a very common pattern in web scrapers. The code might be looking for a specific `<div>` or `<h1>` with text like "Search results for..." to confirm the page is valid. If the site sometimes renders that element differently (or it's delayed by JavaScript), this check would fail, even if the torrent data itself was scraped perfectly. This is a prime suspect for intermittent failures.

2.  **A Data Integrity Check is Failing:** Another strong possibility. The code might be checking if *every* one of the 5 results has a valid, non-empty magnet link, a parsable size, and a seeder count greater than -1. It's entirely possible for a website to list a torrent in its results table that has a broken or missing detail, which would cause this validation to fail for the entire batch.

3.  **A Flawed Item Count Check:** You correctly identified this as less likely, but it's still possible. For example, the code might have a bug like `if count != 5`, which would trigger a retry if it found 4 or 6 results. A more robust check would be `if count == 0`, triggering a retry only when no results are found.

By adding the detailed logging, the application will be forced to tell the user exactly why it's misbehaving, and the fix will likely become obvious.
